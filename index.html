Former members include successive lead vocalists Bon Scott (who later joined AC/DC), John Swan (who also played drums and later had a solo career), and his brother Jimmy Barnes (Cold Chisel).

          <h2>No Value</h2>
          <p>Value, also known as rarity or tiers, is the classification of weapons based on how rare they are to obtain. Although some weapons are rarer than some in the tier above them, none have ever been promoted to a different value, and rarely have any weapons been downgraded a tier, such as in the case of Flames. The value of a weapon is sometimes referred to by the color label of its value.</p>
